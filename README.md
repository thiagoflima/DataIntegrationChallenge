# Data Integration Challenge (by Carzuilha)

This project contains my set of source codes for the Data Integration Challenge.

## Utilized Material

These sources are written in Go language. Sou, you must have a Go compiler (you don't say!). Also, you will need two packages to compile the sources:

- [**SQLite3**](http://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3), to handle the database;
- [**Mux**](http://github.com/gorilla/mux), to handle the HTTP protocol.

I choose to use SQLite because I didn't want to set up a complex database to do the test.

## Additional Info

Some things you must know about this project:

 - I NEVER did anything with the Go language before,  so you might encounter some typos or bad coding. I tried to do my best!
 - Ah, you'll need the GCC compiler to install the SQLite3 package (you'll find more info about this on the [Github project](http://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) of the library).
 - I ran the application using the `cmd` prompt for Windows, passing arguments... so, if you run the program using the command-line, you'll see all the arguments available.
 - At the last minute, I noticed that automated tests were mandatory. Since I'm out of time, I didn't write them. Sorry!

## Conclusion

I'd like to thank you for the opportunity at all. It was a fun challenge, besides anything. See ya!
